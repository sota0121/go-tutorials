# [Tutorial: Getting started with fuzzing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/fuzz)

from: https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/fuzz

> This tutorial introduces the basics of fuzzing in Go. With fuzzing, random data is run against your test in an attempt to find vulnerabilities or crash-causing inputs. Some examples of vulnerabilities that can be found by fuzzing are SQL injection, buffer overflow, denial of service and cross-site scripting attacks.

> In this tutorial, youâ€™ll write a fuzz test for a simple function, run the go command, and debug and fix issues in the code.
